# GitHub Pages Extension (for Chrome)

## Function
With this extension, you can view the website on GitHub Pages just by right-cliking the link of an html file in the repository and choose a newly added menu "preview in GitHub Pages" in the context menus. Besides, you can see the code list on GitHub just by right-cliking on a website on GitHub Pages and choose an option "show the source codes" in the menu.  
The permission to access github.com and *.github.io are given by nature. Unless you would like to use this tool in all the websites containing a link to a html file on GitHub (this must be a very rare case!), you don't need to show the icon on the address bar or anywhere.

## Install
First, download [the src directory](https://github.com/notolyte/pagesExtension/tree/main/src) to wherever you like.  
Second, Access extensions list (Google Chrome: "chrome://extensions", Opera: "extensions", Edge: "edge://extensions")), enable "Developer Mode" by turning on the switch in the upper right corner, and load the source files you've just donwloaded from "load unpacked" button. Now done.

## Publishment
I didn't publish the source file because I was not motivated enough, since I just made this tool for my convenience. However, if you want to publish this extension, you can apply for the store in place of me, without any permission or contact. Instead, note the link to my repository to the introduction or anywhere, if you submit the source file perfectly as I coded.

## Use
You can download, upload, modify or share my source files for free as long as you don't try to abuse it.
